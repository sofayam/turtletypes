An attempt to use open source ontology tools to get stuff done

meanstreets.ttl produced with Protege with intentional failure

pellet installed next door from https://github.com/stardog-union/pellet

alias pele="sh ~/repos/pellet/cli/target/pelletcli/bin/pellet" so that you can actually call it

Lots of strange warnings

Actually complains about the intentional bad setting of attribute of the wrong type
